Catch is a simple game about catching objects that are falling, and catching them before they hit the ground to earn points for each one.

For different classes and components, it is likely that the it will need a GameManager to track different data like points and the game state. Past this, what would then be needed is a script for the falling objects and the bottom boundry to control the physics 
and abilities of both.

The main data to be collected is the amount of objects the player catches, being points, and the amount of objects that hit the ground without being caught.
